TODO (Team 7):
----------------

- SRIC: Send data to target (and waiting for response) or prepare data for polling

- Main: Better look, better icons, maybe route planing option, more menu items?

- ReportSheet: Put algorithm behind the code to create a report sheet (hardcoded path like c:\mp\ or 'browse folder' or 'browse files').

- ImageViewer: Rename to a better introducing, let it check images in a specific folder (hardcoded or via 'browse folder'), add a refresh-button to check folder inside

- optional: add a config-file for the modules if they use things like 'browser folder' (save path) or ftp data
